# ğŸ“š CS50P Learning Journal
I'm learning Python through Harvard's CS50P course and using this repo to track my journey!

## ğŸ§ª Lesson 1: Hello World
ğŸ’Œ:: 'code1.py'

ğŸ§ : Learned how to use 'print()' and 'input()' + other strings and functions! "def" to define my own function!

ğŸ’¬: lowkey super fun! starting small, almost 2 hour long lecture, didnt get bored surprisingly! Also started practicing on my own. Kinda fun ngl. I did keep forgetting abt the indentation ğŸ˜­
